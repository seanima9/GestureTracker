# Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition System ðŸ«´

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time hand gesture recognition system by leveraging video stream data. The system captures video through a camera, processes and analyzes the video frames to detect hand landmarks, and uses these landmarks to recognize specific hand gestures via a trained neural network model.

## Development Stages

### 1. Set Up Video Capture
- **Tool**: `opencv-python` (`cv2`)
- **Description**: Capture real-time video streams from a camera. Initial frame preprocessing is also performed at this stage to prepare frames for hand landmark detection.

### 2. Extract Hand Landmarks with MediaPipe
- **Tool**: `mediapipe`
- **Description**: Process video frames to detect hands and extract hand landmarks, including the x, y, and z coordinates of key points on the hand.

### 3. Preprocess Data for Neural Network
- **Tool**: `numpy`
- **Description**: Normalize and possibly flatten the landmark data to prepare it for processing by the neural network.

### 4. Design and Train Your Neural Network
- **Tool**: `tensorflow` or `keras`
- **Description**: Develop a neural network model that learns from the hand landmarks to recognize specific gestures. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters for optimal performance.

### 5. Real-Time Gesture Prediction
- **Integration**: Use the trained model to predict gestures in real-time for each processed video frame.

### 6. Optimize and Evaluate
- **Tools**: `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
- **Description**: Continuously evaluate and optimize the model's performance and the preprocessing steps to improve accuracy and processing speed.
